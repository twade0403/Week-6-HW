# Week-6-HW

## This weeks homework assignment ended up being really interesting for me.  I had a lot of fun designing the css of the website, however the js is still a struggle for me.

## I feel I am still relying too much on the internet for my help with js, and I believe practice and repitition will get me to where I need to be.
